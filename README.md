# AutomatingFOSSE


This is a github repository for me to share the things I've found that work with SecureCRT by VanDyke. The version that I use at my property is 6.5.4 using VBScript.

I'm going to slowly over time add "pieces" off things from my work checklist that I've figured out how to automate, and I'm going to comment it as much as possible so that others can hopefully replicate it at their workplace.
